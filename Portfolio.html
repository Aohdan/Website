            <h2>My Experiences</h2>
            <p>I've spent the past year at CART taking a Web Applications class that has taught me to introduce me to coding and how websites are designed and  the full process as well as the coding.</p>
            <p>Not only has the classroom been a big focus been, I've been in the gym playing volleyball and competeting for Buchanan's 6th valley championship in a row. With volleyball being another passion of mine it has been an honor to be in such a well developed and successful program.</p>
            <h2>The End Goal</h2>
            <p>After attending college at a UC and getting my Bachelor's I'll work my way up to work at the top gaming company. For a while it was Blizzard Entertainment, but when time comes it could be someone else. In the end, the goal is to work for the best.</p>
